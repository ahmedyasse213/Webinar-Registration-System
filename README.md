Webinar registration system projects can teach you about HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL (You can choose another database system), Node.js(You can choose another technology for backends like Python or PHP), and more. With the necessary knowledge of these technologies, you can find tons of different ways to improve your developer skillset.

The great thing about this project is that you can take an existing registration system and really immerse yourself into it by implementing your own changes to the design of the site.
